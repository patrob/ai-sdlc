# Simplify story IDs to sequential format

## Summary

Replace complex auto-generated story IDs (e.g., `story-mk68fjh7-fvbt`) with simple sequential IDs (e.g., `S-0001`) that are easy to remember, type, and communicate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] New stories get sequential IDs: S-0001, S-0002, S-0003, etc.
- [x] Existing stories are migrated to the new format
- [x] Story commands (status, details, run) work with new ID format
- [x] ID column width is reduced to fit shorter IDs
- [x] All tests pass
