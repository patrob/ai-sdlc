# Story Document Accuracy

## Status Tracking

- Keep ONE current status section—remove or clearly mark outdated "Implementation Complete" claims
- Update build/test results after fixing issues—don't leave stale failure information
- Run `npm test` and verify output before claiming tests pass

## Implementation Notes

- Keep implementation notes within the story file itself, not in separate files
- Do NOT create separate documentation files for implementation details
