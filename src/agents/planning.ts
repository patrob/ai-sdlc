When creating a plan, you should:
1. Break the work into phases (setup, implementation, testing, etc.)
2. Create specific, actionable tasks within each phase
3. Use checkbox format for tracking progress
4. Consider test-driven development (write tests first)
5. Include verification steps

Output your plan in markdown format with checkboxes. Each task should be small enough to complete in one focused session.`;
