# Ability to send work back to an agent for refinement with review feedback

## User Story

**As a** system orchestrator running in auto mode  
**I want** to automatically send failed work back to the originating agent with review feedback and additional context  
**So that** the agent can refine their work and address the issues without manual intervention

## Summary

When a review agent identifies issues with completed work (research, implementation, etc.), the system should automatically route the work back to the original agent along with:
- The review feedback detailing what failed
- New context or requirements that emerged during review
- Clear guidance on what needs to be reworked

This creates a feedback loop that enables agents to iteratively improve their output until it passes review, particularly important in autonomous (auto) mode where human intervention is minimized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System detects when a review agent marks work as "failed" or "needs revision"
- [ ] Failed work is automatically routed back to the original agent (research, planning, implementation, etc.)
- [ ] Review feedback is packaged with the returned work, including:
  - [ ] Specific issues identified during review
  - [ ] Any new context discovered during review
  - [ ] Clear actionable items for what needs to be fixed
- [ ] Original agent receives the work with full historical context (previous attempts, review notes)
- [ ] Agent can access both the original work and the review feedback
- [ ] System tracks the number of refinement iterations to prevent infinite loops
- [ ] In auto mode, the refinement loop executes without requiring manual approval
- [ ] Agent produces updated work addressing the review feedback
- [ ] Updated work is automatically sent back through the review process
- [ ] System logs each refinement iteration for audit/debugging purposes

## Constraints & Edge Cases

**Constraints:**
- Maximum refinement iterations should be configurable (e.g., 3 attempts before escalating to manual review)
- Review feedback must be structured and actionable (not just "this is wrong")
- System must maintain state across refinement iterations

**Edge Cases:**
- Agent repeatedly fails to address the same issue (stuck in loop)
- Review feedback is ambiguous or contradictory
- Original agent is no longer available or has been updated/changed
- Work dependencies change between refinement iterations
- Multiple concurrent refinement loops for different pieces of work
- Review agent and refinement agent disagree on requirements interpretation

## Dependencies

- Review agent capability must be implemented first
- Agent routing/orchestration system must support feedback loops
- State management for tracking work across iterations

## Technical Considerations

- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern to prevent infinite loops
- Define clear data structure for review feedback
- Ensure thread-safety for concurrent refinement operations
- May need queue/message bus for asynchronous work routing

## Research

Perfect! Now I have enough context to provide comprehensive research findings. Let me compile the research report:

# Research: Ability to send work back to an agent for refinement with review feedback

## 1. Relevant Existing Patterns and Code to Reference

### Current Workflow Architecture

The system uses a **state-machine-based workflow** with clear stages:

1. **Backlog** → `refine` → **Ready**
2. **Ready** → `research` → `plan` → `implement` → **In-Progress**
3. **In-Progress** → `review` → `create_pr` → **Done**

Key files demonstrating this pattern:
- **`src/core/kanban.ts`** (lines 64-151): The `assessState()` function generates recommended actions based on story state
- **`src/cli/runner.ts`** (lines 26-227): The `WorkflowRunner` class orchestrates action execution
- **`src/types/index.ts`** (lines 34-43): `ActionType` enum defines all possible actions

### Story State Tracking

Stories already track workflow progress through frontmatter fields:
```typescript
// src/types/index.ts (lines 6-25)
export interface StoryFrontmatter {
  research_complete: boolean;
  plan_complete: boolean;
  implementation_complete: boolean;
  reviews_complete: boolean;
  last_error?: string;  // Already supports error tracking!
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Review Agent Pattern

The existing review agent (`src/agents/review.ts`) demonstrates:
- **Multi-faceted review**: Code, Security, and Product Owner reviews run in parallel (lines 46-50)
- **Review feedback storage**: Appends structured feedback to story content (lines 53-72)
- **Pass/fail determination**: Simple heuristic checks for blocking issues (lines 74-76)
- **Currently moves to done on pass** - no feedback loop exists

### Agent Execution Pattern

All agents follow a consistent pattern:
```typescript
// From src/agents/research.ts, planning.ts, etc.
export async function runAgent(
  storyPath: string,
  sdlcRoot: string
): Promise<AgentResult> {
  const story = parseStory(storyPath);
  const changesMade: string[] = [];
  
  try {
    // Execute agent work
    // Update story with results
    // Mark phase as complete
    return { success: true, story, changesMade };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, story, changesMade, error };
  }
}
```

### Workflow State Persistence

The system already has infrastructure for tracking workflow state:
- **`src/core/workflow-state.ts`**: Saves/loads workflow execution state
- **`src/types/workflow-state.ts`**: Defines state structure with completed actions history
- **Purpose**: Enables `--continue` flag to resume after interruption

This infrastructure could be extended to track refinement iterations.

---

## 2. Files/Modules That Likely Need Modification

### Core Changes Required

#### A. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)

**New types needed:**
```typescript
// Refinement tracking
export interface RefinementIteration {
  iteration: number;
  agentType: ActionType;
  startedAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  reviewFeedback?: string;
  result: 'success' | 'failed' | 'in_progress';
}

// Extended StoryFrontmatter
export interface StoryFrontmatter {
  // ... existing fields
  refinement_iterations?: RefinementIteration[];
  refinement_count?: number; // Quick access to iteration count
  max_refinement_attempts?: number; // Configurable per-story or global
}

// New action type for rework
export type ActionType =
  | 'refine'
  | 'research'
  | 'plan' 
  | 'implement'
  | 'review'
  | 'create_pr'
  | 'move_to_done'
  | 'rework';  // NEW: Send back for refinement

// Review result structure
export interface ReviewResult extends AgentResult {
  passed: boolean;
  reviewType: 'code' | 'security' | 'product_owner';
  issues: ReviewIssue[];
}

export interface ReviewIssue {
  severity: 'blocker' | 'critical' | 'major' | 'minor';
  category: string;
  description: string;
  suggestedFix?: string;
}
```

#### B. Review Agent (`src/agents/review.ts`)

**Changes needed:**
1. **Structured review results** (currently returns plain text):
   - Parse LLM responses to extract structured issues
   - Classify issues by severity
   - Return `ReviewResult` instead of plain string

2. **Determine pass/fail more robustly**:
   - Replace simple keyword matching (lines 74-76)
   - Use structured issue severity levels
   - Configurable thresholds (e.g., "fail if any blockers or 3+ critical issues")

3. **Generate actionable feedback**:
   - Bundle review issues into a structured feedback object
   - Include specific file locations and suggested fixes
   - Reference original acceptance criteria that failed

**Example refactoring:**
```typescript
// Current (line 74-76):
const allPassed = !codeReview.toLowerCase().includes('block') &&
                  !securityReview.toLowerCase().includes('critical') &&
                  !poReview.toLowerCase().includes('reject');

// Proposed:
const reviewResult = evaluateReviews([codeReview, securityReview, poReview]);
if (!reviewResult.passed) {
  return createReworkAction(story, reviewResult);
}
```

#### C. New Rework Agent (`src/agents/rework.ts`)

**Purpose:** Coordinate sending work back with context

**Responsibilities:**
1. Package review feedback with original work
2. Increment refinement iteration counter
3. Check against max iteration limit (circuit breaker)
4. Route to appropriate agent (research, planning, or implementation)
5. Reset completion flags as needed

**Interface:**
```typescript
export async function runReworkAgent(
  storyPath: string,
  sdlcRoot: string,
  reviewFeedback: ReviewResult,
  targetPhase: 'research' | 'plan' | 'implement'
): Promise<AgentResult>
```

#### D. State Assessor (`src/core/kanban.ts`)

**Changes needed (lines 64-151):**

1. **Add rework action detection**:
```typescript
// After review, check if work needs rework
for (const story of inProgressItems) {
  if (story.frontmatter.implementation_complete && !story.frontmatter.reviews_complete) {
    // Check if reviews failed
    if (hasFailedReview(story)) {
      recommendedActions.push({
        type: 'rework',
        storyId: story.frontmatter.id,
        storyPath: story.path,
        reason: `Story needs rework based on review feedback`,
        priority: story.frontmatter.priority + 450, // High priority
      });
    } else {
      // Normal review path
      recommendedActions.push({
        type: 'review',
        // ...
      });
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Add iteration limit checks**:
   - Skip stories that exceeded max refinement attempts
   - Flag for manual intervention

#### E. Workflow Runner (`src/cli/runner.ts`)

**Changes needed:**

1. **Add rework action handler** (line 161-184):
```typescript
private async executeAction(action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    // ... existing cases
    case 'rework':
      return runReworkAgent(action.storyPath, this.sdlcRoot, action.context);
  }
}
```

2. **Circuit breaker for infinite loops** (line 94-126):
   - Already has `maxActions = 100` safety limit
   - Add per-story iteration tracking
   - Escalate to manual review after N attempts

#### F. Story Module (`src/core/story.ts`)

**New helper functions needed:**

```typescript
// Track refinement attempts
export function recordRefinementAttempt(
  story: Story,
  agentType: ActionType,
  reviewFeedback: string
): void;

// Check iteration limits
export function canRetryRefinement(story: Story, maxAttempts: number): boolean;

// Reset phase completion flags for rework
export function resetPhaseCompletion(
  story: Story,
  phase: 'research' | 'plan' | 'implement'
): void;
```

#### G. Configuration (`src/core/config.ts`)

**New config options:**

```typescript
export interface Config {
  // ... existing fields
  refinement: {
    maxIterations: number; // Default: 3
    escalateOnMaxAttempts: 'error' | 'manual' | 'skip'; // Default: 'manual'
    enableCircuitBreaker: boolean; // Default: true
  };
}
```

---

## 3. External Resources & Best Practices

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Purpose**: Prevent infinite loops when agents repeatedly fail the same check
- **Implementation**: Track consecutive failures, open circuit after threshold
- **Reference**: Martin Fowler's [Circuit Breaker pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html)
- **Application**: After 3 failed attempts, escalate to manual review instead of retrying

### Exponential Backoff (Optional Enhancement)
- **Purpose**: For rate-limited API calls during retries
- **Not immediately needed**: Current implementation is synchronous and sequential
- **Future consideration**: If parallel agent execution is added

### Structured Feedback Formats
- **JSON Schema for review results**: Ensures consistent feedback structure
- **SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)**: Industry standard for code analysis results
- **Application**: Could format review feedback as SARIF for tool compatibility

### State Machine Validation
- **Ensure valid state transitions**: e.g., can't go from "done" back to "research" without explicit rework action
- **State transition diagram**: Document allowed flows including feedback loops
- **Current implementation**: Implicit in `assessState()`, should be made explicit

### Audit Trail Best Practices
- **Immutable history**: Each refinement attempt should append, not replace
- **Timestamps**: Already present in workflow state
- **Actor tracking**: Could add which agent/review triggered rework
- **Application**: Use `refinement_iterations` array to maintain complete history

---

## 4. Potential Challenges & Risks

### A. Infinite Loop Prevention
**Risk:** Agent gets stuck in a loop, repeatedly failing the same review check

**Mitigation:**
- Hard limit on iterations (configurable, default 3)
- Detect repeated identical failures (compare review feedback hash)
- Circuit breaker pattern to escalate after threshold
- Manual intervention required after max attempts

### B. State Consistency
**Risk:** Story state becomes inconsistent if rework fails mid-process

**Mitigation:**
- Atomic updates to story frontmatter
- Use existing `workflow-state.ts` infrastructure to track in-progress rework
- Transaction-like semantics: only mark complete after successful rework
- Already using `write-file-atomic` for crash safety (line 70 of workflow-state.ts)

### C. Review Feedback Quality
**Risk:** LLM-generated review feedback is ambiguous, making rework ineffective

**Mitigation:**
- Structured review prompts with explicit output format
- Parse and validate review responses before sending to rework
- Include specific file locations and line numbers in feedback
- Provide examples in review agent prompt

**Example:**
```typescript
const REVIEW_PROMPT_SUFFIX = `
Output format (JSON):
{
  "passed": false,
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "blocker",
      "category": "security",
      "file": "src/auth.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "description": "Password stored in plaintext",
      "suggestedFix": "Use bcrypt to hash passwords before storage"
    }
  ]
}
`;
```

### D. Agent Context Management
**Risk:** Rework agent needs full context from original work plus all review feedback

**Mitigation:**
- Story content already accumulates research, plan, implementation notes
- Append review feedback to dedicated section
- Include iteration number in section headers
- Provide full story content to rework agent (already done for all agents)

### E. Conflicting Review Feedback
**Risk:** Code review says "add more abstraction", PO review says "keep it simple"

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize review types (security > PO > code quality)
- Highlight conflicts explicitly in rework instructions
- May require manual resolution for contradictory feedback
- Consider parallel reviews vs. sequential (security first, then code, then PO)

### F. Performance in Auto Mode
**Risk:** Feedback loops significantly increase time to completion

**Mitigation:**
- Already has action counter and safety limit (maxActions = 100)
- Track time spent per story, warn if excessive
- Option to skip automatic rework and require manual approval
- Stage gates already exist (lines 189-199 of runner.ts)

### G. Regression in Previously Passing Work
**Risk:** Rework to fix one issue breaks something that previously worked

**Mitigation:**
- Preserve test results from previous iterations
- Compare before/after test coverage
- Review feedback should reference specific failures, not broad "redo everything"
- Consider snapshot testing for critical components

---

## 5. Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Must Be Implemented First
✅ **Review agent** - Already exists (`src/agents/review.ts`)
✅ **Agent routing system** - Already exists (`src/cli/runner.ts`)
✅ **State management** - Already exists (`src/core/workflow-state.ts`)

### Should Be Enhanced Before This Story
⚠️ **Structured review results**: Current review agent returns plain text (lines 46-127 of review.ts)
- Need to parse or structure LLM output
- Define `ReviewResult` and `ReviewIssue` types
- Update review prompts to request structured output

⚠️ **Agent error handling**: Currently basic (last_error field)
- Extend to track error categories
- Distinguish between agent failures vs. review failures
- Separate "technical error" from "work didn't meet requirements"

### Can Be Implemented in Parallel
- Configuration system enhancements (max iterations, circuit breaker settings)
- Audit logging improvements (already logs to workflow state)
- UI/CLI improvements to display iteration count and feedback

### External Dependencies
📦 **None** - All required packages already in `package.json`:
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` - For LLM agents
- `gray-matter` - For story frontmatter parsing
- `write-file-atomic` - For crash-safe file writes

---

## 6. Implementation Approach Recommendation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Prerequisite)
1. **Enhance review agent to return structured results**
   - Define `ReviewResult` type with issues array
   - Update prompts to request JSON output
   - Parse and validate review responses
   - Add severity classification

2. **Add refinement tracking to story frontmatter**
   - `refinement_iterations` array
   - `refinement_count` counter
   - Helper functions in `story.ts`

### Phase 2: Core Feedback Loop
3. **Create rework agent** (`src/agents/rework.ts`)
   - Accept review feedback as input
   - Package with original work
   - Route to appropriate agent (research/plan/implement)
   - Increment iteration counter

4. **Update state assessor** to detect failed reviews
   - Check for review failures
   - Generate `rework` actions instead of `create_pr`
   - Respect iteration limits

5. **Update workflow runner** to handle rework actions
   - Add case for `rework` action type
   - Call rework agent with feedback context

### Phase 3: Safety & Observability
6. **Implement circuit breaker**
   - Check max iterations before executing rework
   - Escalate to manual review on limit
   - Add configuration options

7. **Enhanced logging**
   - Track rework attempts in workflow state
   - Log iteration history for debugging
   - Display iteration count in CLI

### Phase 4: Polish
8. **Testing & validation**
   - Test infinite loop prevention
   - Verify state consistency across rework cycles
   - Validate audit trail completeness

9. **Documentation & configuration**
   - Update README with feedback loop behavior
   - Document max iterations setting
   - Add examples of rework scenarios

---

## 7. Risk Mitigation Checklist

- ✅ **Atomic file writes**: Already using `write-file-atomic`
- ✅ **Workflow state tracking**: Infrastructure exists
- ⚠️ **Iteration limit**: Must implement circuit breaker
- ⚠️ **Structured feedback**: Must enhance review agent
- ⚠️ **State validation**: Add explicit state transition guards
- ⚠️ **Audit trail**: Extend to track all refinement attempts
- ⚠️ **Manual override**: Add CLI command to force-complete or skip rework

---

## 8. Success Metrics

**How to validate this feature works:**

1. **Functional**:
   - Story with failing review automatically triggers rework action
   - Rework agent receives review feedback
   - Agent makes corrections addressing feedback
   - Updated work passes review on retry
   - Process completes without manual intervention in auto mode

2. **Safety**:
   - Circuit breaker prevents infinite loops (max 3 iterations by default)
   - Escalation to manual review after max attempts
   - No corrupted story files or state inconsistencies

3. **Observability**:
   - CLI displays "Rework iteration 2/3" messaging
   - Story frontmatter shows complete iteration history
   - Workflow state file tracks all refinement attempts
   - `details` command shows review feedback and rework status

---

## 9. Example Workflow Flow

### Without Feedback Loop (Current):
```
Ready → research → plan → implement → review (FAIL) → [stops, manual fix needed]
```

### With Feedback Loop (Proposed):
```
Ready → research → plan → implement → review (FAIL)
  → rework(implement, feedback) → implement → review (FAIL)
  → rework(implement, feedback) → implement → review (PASS)
  → create_pr → Done
```

### With Circuit Breaker:
```
Ready → research → plan → implement → review (FAIL)
  → rework(1/3) → implement → review (FAIL)
  → rework(2/3) → implement → review (FAIL)
  → rework(3/3) → implement → review (FAIL)
  → [escalate to manual review, set last_error, stop auto mode]
```

---

## Summary

This feature is **well-aligned** with the existing architecture. The codebase already has:
- ✅ Agent orchestration framework
- ✅ State machine workflow
- ✅ Story state tracking
- ✅ Review agent infrastructure
- ✅ Error tracking (`last_error`)

**Key additions needed:**
1. Structured review results (enhance existing review agent)
2. Rework agent (new file)
3. Refinement iteration tracking (extend story frontmatter)
4. Circuit breaker logic (new helper functions)
5. State assessor updates (detect failed reviews)

**Estimated effort:** **Large** (as specified) - involves multiple components and careful state management, but builds on solid existing patterns.

## Implementation Plan

### Implementation Notes (2026-01-09)

Let me create a comprehensive summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Complete! 🎉

I've successfully implemented the **Agent Refinement Feedback Loop** feature as specified in the story. Here's what was delivered:

### Core Implementation

#### 1. **Rework Agent** (`src/agents/rework.ts`)
- Coordinates sending failed work back to appropriate agents
- Records refinement attempts in story frontmatter
- Implements circuit breaker pattern (max 3 iterations by default)
- Packages review feedback with context
- Resets appropriate completion flags for rework
- Appends detailed refinement notes to story content

#### 2. **Enhanced State Assessor** (`src/core/kanban.ts`)
- Added `hasFailedReview()` helper to detect rejected reviews
- Generates `rework` actions when reviews fail
- Prioritizes rework actions (priority + 450) for fast feedback
- Enforces circuit breaker at max iterations
- Escalates to manual intervention when limit reached
- Respects per-story `max_refinement_attempts` overrides

#### 3. **Enhanced Workflow Runner** (`src/cli/runner.ts`)
- Added `rework` case to action executor
- Automatically triggers target phase agent after rework setup
- Displays clear iteration counts and target phases
- Integrates seamlessly with auto mode

#### 4. **Type Definitions** (Already existed in `src/types/index.ts`)
- `RefinementIteration` interface for tracking attempts
- `ReworkContext` for passing feedback to agents
- `ReviewResult` with structured issues
- Extended `StoryFrontmatter` with refinement fields

#### 5. **Configuration** (Already in `src/core/config.ts`)
- `refinement.maxIterations` (default: 3)
- `refinement.escalateOnMaxAttempts` (default: 'manual')
- `refinement.enableCircuitBreaker` (default: true)

### Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:

1. **`tests/agents/rework.test.ts`** (15 tests)
   - Records refinement attempts
   - Resets correct completion flags
   - Triggers circuit breaker
   - Appends refinement notes
   - Determines target phases

2. **`tests/core/kanban-rework.test.ts`** (8 tests)
   - Detects failed reviews
   - Generates rework actions
   - Respects circuit breaker
   - Prioritizes rework correctly
   - Tracks iterations
   - Respects per-story overrides

3. **`tests/integration/refinement-loop.test.ts`** (3 tests)
   - Complete fail → rework → pass cycle
   - Multiple iteration escalation
   - Refinement history tracking

### Documentation

Created `REFINEMENT_LOOP.md` with:
- Complete feature overview
- Configuration guide
- Workflow diagrams
- CLI output examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Architecture decisions

### Key Features Delivered

✅ **Automatic Detection**: System detects `ReviewDecision.REJECTED` and triggers rework
✅ **Structured Feedback**: Review issues with severity, category, description, and suggested fixes
✅ **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents infinite loops with configurable max iterations (default: 3)
✅ **Intelligent Phase Targeting**: Determines whether to rework research, plan, or implement
✅ **Complete Context**: Agents receive original work + all review feedback + iteration history
✅ **Auto Mode Compatible**: Works seamlessly without manual intervention
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete history in frontmatter and story content
✅ **Configurable**: Global and per-story refinement limits

### Workflow Example

```
1. Story completes implementation
2. Review agent runs → finds issues → returns REJECTED
3. State assessor detects failure → generates rework action
4. Rework agent:
   - Records iteration #1
   - Appends feedback to story
   - Resets implementation_complete flag
5. Implementation agent re-runs with feedback context
6. Review agent runs again
7. If APPROVED → create PR
8. If REJECTED → repeat (up to 3 times)
9. If max iterations → escalate to manual intervention
```

### CLI Output

```bash
⟳ Reworking "feature-xyz" (iteration 2/3, target: implement)
  → Recorded refinement attempt 2
  → Added refinement iteration 2 notes to story
  → Reset implement_complete flag for rework
  ↳ Triggering implement agent for refinement...
```

### All Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ System detects when review marks work as "failed"  
✅ Failed work automatically routed back to original agent  
✅ Review feedback packaged with specific issues and context  
✅ Agent receives full historical context (previous attempts, review notes)  
✅ System tracks refinement iterations in frontmatter  
✅ Circuit breaker prevents infinite loops  
✅ Auto mode executes refinement without manual approval  
✅ Updated work sent back through review process

- ✅ Concurrent refinement loops (per-story tracking)
- ✅ Mid-cycle config changes (per-story snapshots)
- ✅ Review agent failures (FAILED vs REJECTED)
- ✅ Ambiguous feedback (fallback text parsing)
