# Auto-mark stories as done after review approval

## Summary

The SDLC process doesn't automatically mark a story as done when the review is approved. After a successful review approval, the story remains in "in-progress" status and must be manually moved to "done". This creates overhead and leads to inaccurate board status.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] After review approval, story status automatically transitions from "in-progress" to "done"
- [ ] The `move_to_done` action is triggered after successful review completion
- [ ] Board status accurately reflects completed work without manual intervention
