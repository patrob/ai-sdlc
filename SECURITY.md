## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate the community's help in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities responsibly.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by using GitHub's Security Advisory feature:

1. Go to the project repository
2. Click the "Security" tab
3. Select "Report a vulnerability" or "Advisories"
4. Follow the guided process to submit your report

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use GitHub's interface, you may email security details to the maintainers (contact information available in the README.md).

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if you have one)
- Your contact information for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

We commit to the following response times:

- **Initial acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report submission
- **Status updates**: At least weekly until the issue is resolved
- **Resolution target**: Actively work toward a fix; timeline depends on severity

Severity levels:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass - fix within days
- **High**: Significant security impact - fix within 1-2 weeks
- **Medium**: Limited impact or requiring specific conditions - fix within 1 month
- **Low**: Minor issues, defense-in-depth improvements - fix in next release

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:

- Give us reasonable time to develop and release a fix before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying data that isn't yours
- Avoid disrupting service availability
- Conduct testing only in authorized environments

We commit to:

- Working diligently to understand and address reported vulnerabilities
- Keeping you informed of our progress
- Providing credit for the discovery (if desired)
- Not taking legal action against researchers following responsible disclosure

## Public Disclosure

Once a fix is available and released, we will:

1. Publish a security advisory describing the vulnerability and impact
2. Credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)
3. Provide guidance on upgrading or applying the fix

We ask that you allow us to coordinate the timing of public disclosure and will typically disclose 7-14 days after a fix is released.

## Security Best Practices

When using this project:

- Keep your version up to date
- Review and follow the project's documentation
- Report any security concerns immediately rather than delaying
- Use appropriate security practices in your own implementation
